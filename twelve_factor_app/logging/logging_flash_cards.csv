Question, Answer
"What is the recommended approach for handling logs in a twelve-factor app?","A twelve-factor app treats logs as event streams and each running process writes its event stream, unbuffered, to stdout. The execution environment captures and collates all streams from the app and routes them to one or more final destinations for viewing and long-term archival."
"What is the format of logs in their raw form?","Logs in their raw form are typically a text format with one event per line, although backtraces from exceptions may span multiple lines."
"What is the role of the execution environment in logging for a twelve-factor app?","The execution environment captures and collates all event streams from the app and routes them to one or more final destinations for viewing and long-term archival. These archival destinations are managed by the execution environment and are not visible to or configurable by the app."
"What are some examples of systems that logs can be sent to for indexing and analysis in a twelve-factor app?","Logs in a twelve-factor app can be sent to systems such as Splunk for log indexing and analysis or Hadoop/Hive for general-purpose data warehousing. These systems allow for great power and flexibility for introspecting an appâ€™s behavior over time."
