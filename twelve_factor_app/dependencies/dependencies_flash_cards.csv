Question,Answer
"What is the recommended practice for declaring and isolating dependencies in a twelve-factor app?","A twelve-factor app never relies on implicit existence of system-wide packages and declares all dependencies via a dependency declaration manifest. It uses a dependency isolation tool during execution to ensure that no implicit dependencies "leak in" from the surrounding system, and the full and explicit dependency specification is applied uniformly to both production and development."
"What is a benefit of explicit dependency declaration?","It simplifies setup for developers new to the app as they only need to have the language runtime and dependency manager installed as prerequisites, and can set up everything needed to run the app's code with a deterministic build command."
"What are examples of system tools that a twelve-factor app should not rely on?","System tools such as ImageMagick or curl that may not exist on all systems where the app may run in the future, or whether the version found on a future system will be compatible with the app. If the app needs to shell out to a system tool, that tool should be vendored into the app."
"What is an example of a tool used for dependency declaration in Ruby and dependency isolation?","Bundler is used for dependency declaration and bundle exec for dependency isolation."
"What tool is used for dependency isolation in Python?","Virtualenv is used for dependency isolation in Python."
