Question,Answer
"What is an app's config?", "An app's config is everything that is likely to vary between deploys, including resource handles to the database, Memcached, and other backing services, credentials to external services, and per-deploy values such as the canonical hostname for the deploy."
"Why is storing config as constants in code a violation of the twelve-factor?","The twelve-factor requires strict separation of config from code, and config varies substantially across deploys, whereas code does not."
"What is a litmus test for whether an app has all config correctly factored out of the code?","Whether the codebase could be made open source at any moment, without compromising any credentials."
"What is the issue with grouping config into named groups or "environments"?","As more deploys of the app are created, new environment names are necessary, resulting in a combinatorial explosion of config which makes managing deploys of the app very brittle. In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars and are never grouped together as "environments"."
"What is the recommended approach to config management in a twelve-factor app?,Storing config in environment variables (env vars) as a language- and OS-agnostic standard, which are easy to change between deploys without changing any code and have little chance of being checked into the code repo accidentally."
